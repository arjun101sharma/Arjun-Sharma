# Project Summary -


The primary goal of this project is to examine and categorize a dataset associated with Netflix. This dataset encompasses diverse attributes linked to Netflix shows and movies, including details like title, genre, release year, duration, rating, and more. The objective is to uncover patterns and similarities within the platform's content and organize them into meaningful clusters.

Initially, the dataset will undergo preprocessing, involving actions like handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations. Additionally, feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract valuable information from the existing attributes.

Subsequently, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be employed to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries will aid in understanding variable distributions, identifying trends, and exploring relationships between different features.

Once the dataset has been comprehensively analyzed, clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based spatial clustering will be implemented. These algorithms aim to group similar Netflix shows and movies based on their attributes. The optimal number of clusters will be determined using methods like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.

Following the clustering process, the results will be assessed and interpreted. Clusters will be scrutinized to comprehend common characteristics and patterns within each group. This analysis is crucial for Netflix in terms of content categorization, enhancing recommendation systems, and formulating content acquisition strategies.

Ultimately, the project's findings and insights from the clustering analysis will be succinctly presented. Visualizations, charts, and graphs will be employed to effectively communicate the project's outcomes. Recommendations may also be provided based on the identified clusters, suggesting potential enhancements or strategies for Netflix to enrich user experience and content offerings.

In summary, this project seeks to analyze a Netflix dataset, utilize clustering techniques to group similar shows and movies, and offer insights and recommendations based on the clustering results. The project aims to enhance understanding of Netflix's content landscape and contribute valuable information to the company's decision-making processes.

# Problem Statement

This dataset comprises a collection of television shows and movies that were accessible on Netflix as of the year 2019. The data was gathered from Flixable, a third-party search engine specifically designed for Netflix.

In a noteworthy report released in 2018, Flixable revealed a fascinating trend: the quantity of TV shows available on Netflix had nearly tripled since 2010. Interestingly, during the same period, the number of movies offered by the streaming service had decreased by over 2,000 titles. This intriguing shift in content distribution raises curiosity and motivates further exploration to uncover additional insights from the dataset.
