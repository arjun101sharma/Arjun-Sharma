# Global Terrorism DataSet

Problem Statement: 
By employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), we aim to pinpoint the regions most affected by terrorism worldwide and understand the changing trends in terrorist actions. Through this analysis, we seek to uncover valuable information pertaining to security concerns. This information can then be utilized to inform and influence the development of effective counter-terrorism strategies.
