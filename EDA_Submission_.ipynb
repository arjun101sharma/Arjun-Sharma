        "\n",
        "The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a freely accessible repository containing data about acts of terrorism across the globe spanning from 1970 to 2017. It encompasses organized information about both local and global instances of terrorism that have taken place within this timeframe. The GTD's scope now comprises over 180,000 such attacks. This compilation is upheld by scholars at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), based at the University of Maryland.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a comprehensive and widely-used dataset that contains information about terrorist incidents around the world. In this project, we conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the GTD to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and characteristics of global terrorism over time. Our objective was to extract meaningful information from the dataset and present it in a coherent manner, shedding light on various aspects of terrorism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Source and Preprocessing:\n",
        "We obtained the Global Terrorism Database, which includes records spanning several decades, containing details about terrorist attacks such as location, date, attack type, target type, and more. Prior to analysis, we conducted preprocessing tasks to handle missing values, ensure data consistency, and convert categorical variables into a more manageable format for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Temporal Trends:\n",
        "We started by examining the temporal trends of terrorism. By plotting the number of attacks over the years, we observed fluctuations and spikes in certain time periods. Further analysis revealed that while the overall number of attacks exhibited variations, there were certain years and regions that experienced a surge in terrorist activities. This prompted us to investigate the potential reasons behind these spikes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geographical Patterns:\n",
        "The geographical distribution of terrorist incidents was another key aspect of our analysis. Through visualizations such as heatmaps and choropleth maps, we visualized the regions most affected by terrorism. This allowed us to identify high-risk areas and understand the concentration of attacks in specific regions. Additionally, we explored whether there were any correlations between geopolitical events and terrorist activities in certain regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Attack Characteristics:\n",
        "We delved into the characteristics of terrorist attacks, examining factors such as attack types, weapon types, and target types. By categorizing and visualizing these attributes, we gained insights into the most common methods used by terrorists and their preferred targets. For instance, we found that bombings and armed assaults were the most prevalent attack types, and civilians and private citizens were frequently targeted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "In this project, our Exploratory Data Analysis of the Global Terrorism Database offered valuable insights into the dynamics of global terrorism. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, we highlighted temporal trends, geographical patterns, attack characteristics, and the identities of perpetrators. This information not only contributes to a better understanding of terrorism but also holds the potential to inform policy decisions aimed at mitigating its impact. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the importance of continued data collection and analysis in countering terrorism effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, by conducting a comprehensive EDA on the Global Terrorism Database, we uncovered significant trends and patterns that provide a foundation for further in-depth analysis and policy-making in the realm of counterterrorism efforts.\n"

Before 2001, the regions were much closer together in terms of activity, eventually all droping to a minimum in 2000.
